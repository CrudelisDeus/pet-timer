**Smart Sleep Timer for a Peaceful Night**


Many of us enjoy watching a movie or listening to a show before falling asleep. However, sometimes, the screen keeps playing all night, disrupting sleep and consuming unnecessary energy. To solve this, I’ve developed a Smart Sleep Timer, a simple yet effective solution for better nighttime rest.

**Key Features:**

- ✅ Automatic Audio Mute – Gradually reduces the volume and mutes the sound after a set time.

- ✅ Screen Lock & Dimming – Prevents visual distractions by locking the screen.

- ✅ Auto Shutdown – Shuts down the PC at a scheduled time to save energy and prevent overnight playback.

With this tool, you can set a timer and let it take care of the rest. Whether you need a silent room for deep sleep or want to avoid unnecessary power consumption, this solution ensures a more comfortable and uninterrupted night.
